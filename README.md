# StampVault

StampVault is a WordPress plugin for stamp collectors (philatelists) to create a digital inventory of their collections and showcase them on their websites easily.

## Features
- Add, manage, and display your stamp collection online
- Showcase your collection with customizable displays
- Built for philatelists by a philatelist

## Custom Post Type
StampVault registers a custom post type called `Stamps` for managing individual stamp entries. Each stamp can have its own details, images, and custom fields, making it easy to catalog and display your collection.

## Custom Taxonomies
StampVault provides several taxonomies to organize your stamps:
- **Stamp Sets:** Group stamps that belong to the same set or series.
- **Themes:** Thematic topics depicted on the stamps (e.g., birds, sports, history).
- **Stamp Types:** Classification such as definitive, commemorative, airmail, etc.
- **Printing Process:** The printing technique used (e.g., lithography, engraving).
- **Countries:** The country or territory that issued the stamp.
- **Credits:** Designers, engravers, or other contributors to the stamp.
